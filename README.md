### 🧠 ABOUT ME

I’m a multidisciplinary designer and frontend developer with a strong foundation in visual communication and a deep passion for crafting user-centered digital experiences.

My career began in the fashion retail industry, where I spent nearly a decade working as a Visual Merchandiser Manager for major brands like H&M and Primark. I was responsible for store layouts, window displays, and visual storytelling an experience that sharpened my eye for aesthetics, spatial balance, and consumer behavior.

Driven by a growing interest in digital environments and spatial design, I attended a 3D architectural rendering bootcamp at IED – Istituto Europeo di Design, where I explored visual storytelling through digital architecture and honed my skills in spatial visualization.

In 2024, I made a bold shift into tech and enrolled in an intensive Full Stack Development program at Boolean, specializing in Frontend Development with a focus on React, JavaScript, and responsive UI. During this time, I discovered my love for UX/UI design the perfect fusion of creativity and logic and began designing interfaces that are not only functional but emotionally engaging.

I’m currently interning as a Frontend Developer at Retex (Team Atoms), contributing to digital projects in the luxury sector. Alongside my internship, I’m pursuing a dual UX/UI Design Master at Talent Garden, where I’m refining my skills in user research, interaction design, wireframing, and prototyping using tools like Figma.

I thrive at the intersection of design and development, and I believe the best digital experiences are born when empathy, beauty, and clean code come together. I’m especially passionate about inclusive, ethical, and accessible design and I’m always exploring ways to make technology feel more human.
